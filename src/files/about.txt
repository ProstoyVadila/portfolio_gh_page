Hi there! üëã

I'm Vadim Gorbachev, a passionate Software Engineer specializing in Python and Go with expertise in building scalable, high-performance systems.
üìç Based in Puerto Princesa, Philippines

What I do:
- Design and implement robust APIs and microservices using Python, Go and Rust
- Optimize database performance with PostgreSQL, Redis, and message brokers like Kafka
- Build distributed systems that handle real-time communication and data processing
- Develop and implement agent-based systems using frameworks such as Langchain and LangGraph
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud infrastructure

My approach:
I believe in writing code that not only works but stands the test of time.
Every system I build is designed with scalability, maintainability, and performance in mind.
I'm passionate about solving complex technical challenges, from WebSocket optimization to ETL pipeline development.

Currently focusing on:
- Microservices architecture and system design
- Real-time data processing and ML model deployment
- Seamless integration of AI Agents into existing non-ML solutions with MCP
- Implementing RAG, working with vector databases to store embeddings

Languages: Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript
Tech Interests: System design, data-intensive applications
Non-tech Interests: motorbike riding, diving

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch!
